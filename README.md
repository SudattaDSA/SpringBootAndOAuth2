Welcome to the Spring Boot and OAuth2 project repository! This project demonstrates how to integrate OAuth2 authentication and authorization into a Spring Boot application. It includes examples of using OAuth2 with various providers and configurations.


This project aims to provide a comprehensive example of integrating OAuth2 authentication and authorization in a Spring Boot application. OAuth2 is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used for token-based authentication and authorization on the internet.

The project follows a standard structure for Spring Boot applications:
  - controller: REST controllers for handling web requests.
  - model: Entity classes representing the application data.
  - repository: Repository interfaces for data access.
  - service: Service classes for business logic.
  - resources: Configuration files and templates.
